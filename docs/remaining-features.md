## Overview

This document provides a summary of the key features developed and delivered in the latest sprint. The focus of this sprint was to introduce advanced functionalities that enhance user engagement and administrative control. The newly implemented features include a comprehensive Balance Sheet, a powerful Admin Panel for system management, and the initial backend integration of the Saki AI Assistant.

These features represent a significant step forward in providing a holistic and intelligent personal finance management tool.

## Balance Sheet Feature

The Balance Sheet feature provides users with a clear and accurate snapshot of their financial net worth. It allows users to track their assets (what they own) and liabilities (what they owe), offering a crucial perspective on their overall financial health beyond just income and expenses.

### Key Functionalities

- **Asset Management**: Users can add, update, and delete various types of assets, such as cash, investments, real estate, and vehicles.
- **Liability Management**: Users can add, update, and delete liabilities, including mortgages, loans, and credit card debt.
- **Net Worth Calculation**: The system automatically calculates the user's net worth (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) in real-time.
- **Data Visualization**: The frontend presents the balance sheet in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format, helping users quickly assess their financial position.

### Architecture

- **Backend**: The backend includes dedicated routes (`/api/balance-sheet`), services, and controllers to handle all CRUD operations for assets and liabilities. All operations are securely tied to the authenticated user.
- **Frontend**: The frontend features an `AssetsSection` and a `LiabilitiesSection` within the user's dashboard, allowing for seamless interaction with their balance sheet data.

## Admin Panel Feature

The Admin Panel is a new, restricted-access area designed for system administrators. This feature provides the tools necessary to manage users and ensure the smooth operation of the RichFlow platform.

### Key Functionalities

- **User Management**: Administrators can view a list of all registered users, inspect their financial data (for support and verification purposes), and manage user accounts.
- **Dashboard Overview**: The panel includes a dashboard that provides a list of users. When they click on a user, 
they are shown a detailed view of their financial data.
- **Secure Access**: Access to the admin panel is strictly controlled and limited to users with administrative privileges, enforced by dedicated backend middleware.

### Architecture

- **Backend**: A set of admin-specific API endpoints (`/api/admin`) has been created to support the panel's functionalities. The `admin.service.ts` contains the business logic for fetching user data and system-wide analytics.
- **Frontend**: A dedicated section of the application under `/admin` has been developed, including components like `AdminPanel`, `AdminHeader`, and `UserList` to provide a comprehensive administrative interface.

## Saki AI Assistant Feature

The Saki AI Assistant is a simple generative AI designed to help users navigate their finances more effectively. The backend infrastructure has been established to support AI-driven insights about their financial data.

### Key Functionalities (Backend Implemented)

- **Personalized Financial Insights**: The AI can analyze a user's income, expenses, and balance sheet to provide personalized tips and observations. It can also suggest ways to improve their financial well-being.
- **Secure Data Handling**: The AI service operates within the user's authenticated session, ensuring that it only accesses the data of the user making the request.

### Architecture

- **Backend**: The core of the feature resides in the backend with a dedicated `ai.controller.ts` and `ai.service.ts`. These modules are responsible for interpreting user data, interacting with other financial services to gather data, and formulating an intelligent response. The `/api/ai` route is protected and handles all interactions with the assistant.
